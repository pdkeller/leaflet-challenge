# The purpose of this challenge was to demonstrate the ability to create visualizations with Leaflet, using both HTML files and JavaScript files. The data set used for this assignment was through the US Earthquakes reporting website and was earthquakes with a magnitude of at least 4.5 over the previous month. The code was to create a visualization that maps the magnitude of each earthquake with a larger radius in respect to a larger radius of the plotted point and a lighter color with regards to a shorter depth. The legend aspect of the code did not work with showing the correct color that corresponds to range of depth. The lightest green is depths of greater than 90 miles deep and the darkest red is depths of less than 10 miles deep.

# The overall code was unsuccessful, but all the points in the data set were plotted with the correct magnitude (size of plot point) and with the correct depth (color of plot point) even though the legend does indicate which color corresponds to which range of depth of the earthquake.
